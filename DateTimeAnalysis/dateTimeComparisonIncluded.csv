<p>Doing some searching, I realized that some people add <code>""use strict"";</code> into their JavaScript code. Once I added the statement, the error stopped appearing.

<pre><code>$('#mySelect').find('option').remove().end().append('&lt;option value=""whatever""&gt;text&lt;/option&gt;').val('whatever');

This interface enables appending <code>File</code> objects to XHR-requests (Ajax-requests).</p>

<p>Btw, this is a new feature - in the past, the ""hidden-iframe-trick"" was used (read about that in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6718664/is-it-possible-to-peform-an-asynchronous-cross-domain-file-upload/6963843"">my other question</a>).</p>

<p>This is how it works (example):</p>

<pre><code>var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(),
    fd = new FormData();

fd.append( 'file', input.files[0] );
xhr.open( 'POST', 'http://example.com/script.php', true );
xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;
xhr.send( fd );
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>input</code> is a <code>&lt;input type=""file""&gt;</code> field, and <code>handler</code> is the success-handler for the Ajax-request.</p>

<p>This works beautifully in all browsers (again, except IE).</p>

<p>Now, I would like to make this functionality work with jQuery. I tried this:</p>

<pre><code>var fd = new FormData();    
fd.append( 'file', input.files[0] );

$.post( 'http://example.com/script.php', fd, handler );
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, that won't work (an ""Illegal invocation"" error is thrown - <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/Uy8Xu.png"">screenshot is here</a>). I assume jQuery expects a simple key-value object representing form-field-names / values, and the <code>FormData</code> instance that I'm passing in is apparently incompatible.</p>

<p>Now, since it is possible to pass a <code>FormData</code> instance into <code>xhr.send()</code>, I hope that it is also possible to make it work with jQuery.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I've created a ""feature ticket"" over at jQuery's Bug Tracker. It's here: <a href=""http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9995"">http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9995</a></p>

<p>I was suggested to use an ""Ajax prefilter""...</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>First, let me give a demo demonstrating what behavior I would like to achieve. </p>

<p>HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form&gt;
    &lt;input type=""file"" id=""file"" name=""file""&gt;
    &lt;input type=""submit""&gt;

</code></pre>

<p>JavaScript:</p>

<pre><code>$( 'form' ).submit(function ( e ) {
    var data, xhr;

    data = new FormData();
    data.append( 'file', $( '#file' )[0].files[0] );

    xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

    xhr.open( 'POST', 'http://hacheck.tel.fer.hr/xml.pl', true );
    xhr.onreadystatechange = function ( response ) {};
    xhr.send( data );

    e.preventDefault();
});
</code></pre>

<p>The above code results in this HTTP-request:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/YJYPm.png"" alt=""multipartformdata""></p>

<p><strong>This is what I need</strong> - I want that ""multipart/form-data"" content-type!</p>

<hr>

<p>The proposed solution would be like so:</p>

<pre><code>$( 'form' ).submit(function ( e ) {
    var data;

    data = new FormData();
    data.append( 'file', $( '#file' )[0].files[0] );

    $.ajax({
        url: 'http://hacheck.tel.fer.hr/xml.pl',
        data: data,
        processData: false,
        type: 'POST',
        success: function ( data ) {
            alert( data );
        }
    });

    e.preventDefault();
});

One of the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s contains a <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> which, using jQuery, will keep the border if an input within it has focus. This works perfectly except that IE6 does not support <code>:hover</code> on any elements other than <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>s. So, for this browser only we are using jQuery to mimic CSS <code>:hover</code> using the <code>$(#element).hover()</code> method.

<p>I was thinking we could use some kind of conditional to stop this behavior. For instance, if we tested on mouse out if any of the inputs had focus, we could stop the border from going away.

<ul>
<li>Ash made me consider not having my API accept <code>Date</code> instances at all, this would be easiest to validate.</li>

<p>Basically what the above code demonstrates is an element being stored into a variable and then removed from dom. Even though the element has been removed from the dom, the variable retains the element as it was when first declared.

<p>The <code>isNull</code> function is my attempt to check for an elements existence from a variable, and it works, but I would like to know if there is an easier way to accomplish the same result.</p>

I'm using a basic Javascript snippet to toggle them. The problem is that the script only uses getElementById, as getElementByClass is not supported in Javascript. And unfortunately I do have to use class and not id to name the DIVs because the DIV names are dynamically generated by my XSLT stylesheet using certain category names.</p>

<p>I know that certain browsers now support getElementByClass, but since Internet Explorer doesn't I don't want to go that route.</p>

<p>I've found scripts using functions to get elements by class (such as #8 on this page: <a href=""http://www.dustindiaz.com/top-ten-javascript/"">http://www.dustindiaz.com/top-ten-javascript/</a>), but I can't figure out how to integrate them with with my toggle script.</p>

<p>Here's the html code. The DIVs themselves are missing since they are generated on page load with XML/XSLT. Thanks so much in advance. </p>

<p>Main Question: How do I get the below Toggle script to get Element by Class instead of get Element by ID?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;

&lt;head&gt;

&lt;!--This is the TOGGLE script--&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
&lt;!--
    function toggle_visibility(id) {
       var e = document.getElementById(id);
       if(e.style.display == 'block')
          e.style.display = 'none';
       else
          e.style.display = 'block';
    }
//--&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;!--the XML/XSLT page contents will be loaded here, with DIVs named by Class separating dozens of li's--&gt;

&lt;a href=""#"" onclick=""toggle_visibility('class1');""&gt;Click here to toggle visibility of class 1 objects&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href=""#"" onclick=""toggle_visibility('class2');""&gt;Click here to toggle visibility of class 2 objects&lt;/a&gt;

<p>[1] Yes, I know that users can forge their useragent string. I'm not concerned.</p>

<p>[2] Yes, I know that programming pros prefer sniffing out feature-support instead of browser-type but I don't feel this approach makes sense in this case. I already know that all (relevant) non-IE browsers support the features that I need and that all pre-v9 IE browsers don't. Checking feature by feature throughout the site would be a waste.</p>

<p>[3] Yes, I know that someone trying to access the site using IE v1 (or >= 20) wouldn't get 'badBrowser' set to true and the warning page wouldn't be displayed properly. That's a risk we're willing to take.</p>

<p>[4] Yes, I know that Microsoft has ""conditional comments"" that can be used for precise browser version detection. IE no longer supports conditional comments as of IE 10, rendering this approach absolutely useless.</p>

"373",373,"2009-11-07 22:02:40",NA,123,274692,"<p>I have a timer in my javascript which needs to emulate clicking a link to go to another page once the time elapses. To do this I'm using jquery's click() function. I have used $().trigger() and window.location also, and I can make it work as intended with all three.</p>

<p>I've observed some weird behavior with click() and I'm trying to understand what happens and why.</p>

<p>I'm using Firefox for everything I describe in this question, but I am also interested in what other browsers will do with this.</p>

<p>If I have not used <code>$('a').bind('click',fn)</code> or <code>$('a').click(fn)</code> to set an event handler, then calling $('a').click() seems to do nothing at all. It does not call the browser's default handler for this event, as the browser does not load the new page.</p>

<p>However, if I set an event handler first, then it works as expected, even if the event handler does nothing.</p>

<pre><code>$('a').click(function(){return true;}).click();
</code></pre>

<p>This loads the new page as if I had clicked the a myself.</p>

<p>So my question is twofold: Is this weird behavior because I'm doing something wrong somewhere? and Why does calling click() do nothing with the default behavior if I haven't created a handler of my own?</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>As Hoffman determined when he tried to duplicate my results, the outcome I described above doesn't actually happen. I'm not sure what caused the events I observed yesterday, but I'm certain today that it was not what I described in the question.</p>

<p>So the answer is that you can't ""fake"" clicks in the browser and that all jquery does is call your event handler. You can still use window.location to change page, and that works fine for me.</p>

However I said to myself that I'm going to face fear today and start using headers purposely. What I have been trying to achieve here is send <code>json</code> data to the browser and use it right away. For example if I have an ajax handler function on ready state 4 which looks like so</p>

<pre><code>function ajaxHandler(response){
    alert(response.text);
}
</code></pre>

<p>and I have set the content-type header in my php</p>

<pre><code>header('Content-Type: application/json');

"445",445,"2012-04-30 09:25:35",NA,109,250555,"<p>I was wondering, JavaScript offers a variety of methods to get the first child element from any element... but which is the best? By best, I mean: most cross browser compatible, fastest, most comprehensive and predictable when it comes to behaviour. A list of methods/properties I use as aliases:</p>

<pre><code>var elem = document.getElementById('container');
var child = elem.children[0];
var child = elem.firstElementChild;//== children[0]
</code></pre>

<p>This works for both cases:</p>

<pre><code>var child = elem.childNodes[0];//or childNodes[1], see below
</code></pre>

<p>That's in case of forms, or div iteration. If I might encounter text elements:</p>

<pre><code>var child = elem.childNodes;//treat as Nodelist
var child = elem.firstChild;
</code></pre>

<p>As far as I can work out, <code>firstChild</code> uses the Nodelist from <code>childNodes</code>, and <code>firstElementChild</code> uses <code>children</code>. I'm basing this assumption on the MDN reference:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>childNode is a reference to the first child element of the element node, or null if there isn't one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm guessing that, in terms of speed the difference, if any, will be next no nothing, since <code>firstElementChild</code> is effectively a reference to <code>children[0]</code>, and the <code>children</code> object is already in memory anyway. </p>

<p>What does throw me is the <code>childNodes</code> object. I've used it to take a look at a form, in a table element. While <code>children</code> lists all form elements, <code>childNodes</code> also seems to include whitespace from the html code:</p>

<pre><code>console.log(elem.childNodes[0]);
console.log(elem.firstChild);
</code></pre>

<p>both log &lt;TextNode textContent=""\n ""&gt;</p>

<pre><code>console.log(elem.childNodes[1]);
console.log(elem.children[0]);
console.log(elem.firstElementChild);
</code></pre>

<p>All log &lt;input type=""text""... How come? I'd understand that one object would allow me to work with the 'raw' HTML code, while the other sticks to the DOM, but the <code>childNodes</code> element seems to work on both levels.</p>

<p>To get back to my initial question: my guess would be: if I want the most comprehensive object, <code>childNodes</code> is the way to go, but because of it's comprehensiveness, it might not be the most predictable in terms of it returning the element I want/expect at any given moment. Cross browser support might also prove to be a challenge in that case, though I could be wrong. </p>

<p>Could anyone clarify the distinction between the objects at hand? If there is a speed difference, however negligible, I'd like to know, too. If I'm seeing this all wrong, feel free to educate me :-).</p>

<p>PS: please, please, I like JavaScript, so yes, I want to deal with this sort of thing. answers like 'jQuery deals with this for you' are not what I'm looking for, hence no jQuery tag.</p>

<li>Google JSAPI</li>
<li>jQuery's site</li>
<li>your own site/server</li>
<li>another CDN</li>
</ul>

<p>I have recently been using Google JSAPI, but have found that it takes a long time to setup an SSL connection or even only to resolve google.com. I have been using the following for Google:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src=""https://www.google.com/jsapi""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
google.load('jquery', '1.3.1');

<p>I like the idea of using Google so it's cached when visiting other sites and to save bandwidth from our server, but if it keeps being the slow portion of the site, I may change the include.</p>

<p>What do you use? Have you had any issues?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Just visited jQuery's site and they use the following method:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3/jquery.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit2:</strong> Here's how I've been including jQuery without any problems for the last year:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src=""//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.3/jquery.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
